# Purpose: This project used SVD (Single-Value Decomposition) to carry out least squares analysis and thus to perform regression on a set of two dimensional data.
## Method: Calculates and writes the coefficients for the SVD analysis to a text file. 
### Files:
- `leastSquares.py`: File with main codes
- `leastSquares.txt`: Output file
- `testLeastSquares.py`: File with codes for testing/debugging

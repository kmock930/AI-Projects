# Purpose: This project computed the pseudo-inverse directly with SVD.
## Method: Uses the Python library function `numpy.linalg.pinv` as well as the knowledge of matricies to output the pseudo-inverse (matrix) from an original matrix into a text file.
### Files:
- `pseudoinverse.py`: File with main codes
- `pseudoinverse.txt`: Output file
- `testPseudoinverse.py`: File with codes for testing/debugging
